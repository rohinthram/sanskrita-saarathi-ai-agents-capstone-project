# Problem Statement
Despite a growing interest in Sanskrit, learners struggle to understand its poetic and scriptural content because traditional comprehension skills and contextual understanding have gradually faded. Meanings, interpretations, and explanations are scattered across books, commentaries, and websites — forcing learners to spend more time searching than actually learning. Without structured practice and effective retention techniques, mastery becomes even more difficult.

As a result, the transformative wisdom of Sanskrit remains inaccessible to many who seek not merely language skills but inner growth through understanding its verses. Sanskrit has always fascinated me — its ability to encode profound knowledge through poetry and songs is unmatched. Learning it is challenging, but deeply rewarding. Even a slight reduction in learning friction can help more people discover answers that guide them toward clarity, purpose, and ultimately, happiness — something every human seeks.

# Why agents?
Agents have the ability to interact with different sources and tools. Help generate some meaning out of verses. AI models LLMs are capable of doing it, but Agents can help it take a step further. We can have deterministic dictionary fetches that are hard for humans especially for those are starting the journey it can be tiresome. Agents can combine the deterministic lookup and probabilistic interpretation of text.

# Target Idea
A multi agent model that can help user translate verses and quiz learners in a smart way.


# Learnings
- Agents easy get Hallucinated
- Agents almost always calls functions the wrong way - MALFORMED_FUNCTION_CALL
